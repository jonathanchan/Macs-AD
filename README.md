Stuff for Macs that are bound to Active Directory

**bind_ad.py**

The work flow is kinda specific for my office. Adjust as needed.

1. If needed update the hostname
2. Bind machine to Active Directory
3. Migrate a local user account to an Active Directory user account
4. Update permissions

Highly recommend looking at what's being done here rather than running this blindly.

**hostname_check.py**

Update the Mac's hostnames to match the Active Directory binding name.
